# MVT to GeoJson decoder

**Status**: The code only works for basic use cases.

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, this is a MVT to GeoJson decoder that I'm writing in Rust ðŸ¦€ to practice.

The code is inspired in [loaders.gl](https://github.com/visgl/loaders.gl) [MVTLoader](https://github.com/visgl/loaders.gl/tree/master/modules/mvt).
